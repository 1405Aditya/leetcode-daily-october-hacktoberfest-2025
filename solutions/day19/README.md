We use recursive DFS to explore all strings reachable from the original string by repeatedly applying the two allowed operations: 
1. adding a to all odd indices 
2. rotating the string by b positions. 
A set keeps track of visited strings to avoid revisiting the same state. During recursion, we generate all possible strings and finally select the lexicographically smallest one from the visited set.
