Problem Description

Given an array of integers nums, an integer k, and a limit on the number of operations numOperations, this algorithm determines the maximum possible frequency of any number after performing at most numOperations modifications within a range of size k.
An operation allows you to increase or decrease a number within a limited range [target, target + k]. The goal is to maximize how many elements can become the same number after using at most the allowed operations.

Approach
1)Frequency Counting: First, we calculate how many times each number appears using a frequency array.

2)Sliding Window Technique: We slide over the possible target values and dynamically maintain a window sum of frequencies within range k.

3)Operations Adjustment: For each target, we calculate how many numbers can be adjusted (incremented or decremented) to match it, but the number of changes cannot exceed numOperations.

4)Track Maximum Frequency: At each step, we track the maximum possible frequency achievable by applying up to numOperations modifications.
Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(N + M)
where N = length of nums, and M = maximum value in nums.

Space Complexity: O(M)
due to the frequency array.
