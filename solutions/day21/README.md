**Problem:** [3346. Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-of-an-element-after-performing-operations-i/)  
**Language:** C++  
**Approach:**  
Sorted the array and used binary search with frequency mapping to determine how many elements can be made equal after performing up to `k` operations. This ensures efficient frequency maximization with optimal time complexity.  

Uses sorting to organize numbers, and maps to track frequency efficiently.
- Leverages binary search to find the range of elements reachable within `k` operations.
- Handles duplicate and edge cases (like all identical elements or single-element arrays).
- Tested successfully on multiple LeetCode test cases.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)
