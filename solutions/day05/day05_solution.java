// Day 05 Problem of Leetcode
// container with most water

/* You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
 Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 Notice that you may not slant the container.*/

// Solution

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = height.length - 1;
        int res = 0;

        while (i < j) {
            res = Math.max(res, (j - i) * Math.min(height[i], height[j]));
            if (height[i] < height[j]) i++;
            else j--;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
